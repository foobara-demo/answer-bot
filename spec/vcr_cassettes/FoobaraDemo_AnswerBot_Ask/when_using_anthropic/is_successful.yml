        pH of honey typically ranges between 3.4 and 6.1, with an average of around
        3.9. This makes honey slightly acidic on the pH scale, which runs from 0 (most
        acidic) to 14 (most alkaline), with 7 being neutral.\n\nSeveral factors can
        influence the exact pH of honey:\n\n1. Floral source: The type of flowers
        bees visit to collect nectar affects the honey''s composition and pH.\n\n2.
        Geographic location: Honey from different regions may have slightly different
        pH levels due to variations in soil and plant species.\n\n3. Processing: Some
        processing methods can affect the pH of honey.\n\n4. Age: As honey ages, its
        pH may change slightly.\n\nThe acidic nature of honey contributes to its ability
        to resist bacterial growth and its long shelf life. This acidity also plays
        a role in honey''s flavor profile and its various culinary and medicinal uses.\n\nIt''s
        worth noting that while honey is acidic, it has an alkalizing effect when
        consumed and metabolized by the body, which is why it''s sometimes considered
        an alkaline-forming food despite its acidic pH."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":14,"output_tokens":253}}'
